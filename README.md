# Lenition Integrated Python System (LIPS)

## Description
LIPS is a unified Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) to streamline the measurement of lenition, a linguistic phenomenon involving the weakening of a consonant production. Traditionally, various lenition algorithms like Harmonic-to-Noise Ratio (HNR) are applied separately to audio data using various Praat and Python scripts, resulting in a tedious, inefficient, and irreproducible process. Our solution integrates these algorithms seamlessly within a single GUI, eliminating the need for researchers to have technical command-line expertise. This user-friendly interface empowers researchers to effortlessly run multiple algorithms, offering a more efficient alternative to the current approach.
